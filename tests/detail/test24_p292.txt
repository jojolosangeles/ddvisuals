#
#  This sequence demonstrates the problem with LWW when clocks on different
#  nodes are NOT identical.  In practice this is impossible, best Google can do
#  is 7ms time window between nodes.
#
#  The system invariant is that when replication is complete, all nodes have the
#  same value for a given key.
#
#  LWW requires the following:
#  - key/value starting timestamp is from Node that first created the key/pair.
#  - a key/value/timestamp setting only occurs if timestamp is later than existing one
#
